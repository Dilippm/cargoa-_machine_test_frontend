# React + Vite Frontend Template

This template provides a minimal setup for developing a React application with Vite. It includes Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a fast development experience and integrates some ESLint rules to ensure code quality.

## Official Plugins

This project uses two official Vite plugins:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): This plugin uses Babel for Fast Refresh, enhancing your React development experience.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): This plugin uses SWC for Fast Refresh, offering a similar experience with an alternative technology stack.

## Getting Started

### Development
1. To start the development server with HMR, use the following command:
